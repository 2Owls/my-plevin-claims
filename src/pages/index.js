          <h1>WHAT IS A PLEVIN CLAIM</h1>
          <p className="text-sm mb-2">These are claims which are related to Payment Protection Insurance (PPI), specifically the commission paid in relation to sale of the PPI. </p>
        </div>
        <div>  
          <p className="text-sm mb-2">In the landmark case Plevin v Paragon Personal Finance ('Plevin'), the Supreme Court ruled that a large commission that was not disclosed to the purchaser at the time of sale created an unfair relationship under the Consumer Credit Act. As a result the Claimant, Mrs Plevin, was entitled to a refund of the commission that was paid to the seller, plus any applicable interest. In the case of Plevin, the commission was over 71% of the PPI premium amount and the Financial Conduct Authority has subsequently confirmed that the average commission was a staggering 67%, and this was rarely disclosed. The good news is that the PPI deadline does not apply to Plevin claims and therefore potentially billions of pounds can still be reclaimed!</p>

        <h1 className="col-span-4">How does the Plevin Free Check work?</h1>
        <div>
          <p className="text-sm mb-2"><strong>We offer this free check</strong> to assess whether there was an undisclosed commission on a PPI policy that you held, before you decide whether you wish to make a claim.</p>
        </div>
        <div>  
          <p className="text-sm mb-2"><strong>This check is completely free of charge</strong> and you are under no obligation to pursue a claim once this free check has been completed.</p>
        </div>  
        <div>  
          <p className="text-sm mb-2"><strong>As part of the free check,</strong> we will contact the financial institution who sold you the PPI policy to obtain information relating to the policy.</p>
        </div>  
        <div>
          <p className="text-sm"><strong>Once the free check is complete,</strong> we will contact you with the results. You can then decide what to do next.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

 

      <div>
        <p className="text-sm text-center">You can pursue a claim yourself without using a Claims Management Company and without cost.  You will first need to complain directly to the appropriate third party who sold you the product and if this is unsuccessful, you can complain through the Financial Ombudsman Service or, if the third party is no longer trading, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.</p>
